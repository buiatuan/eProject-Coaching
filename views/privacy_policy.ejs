           <p> edX and each Member that provides courses through the edX Site care about the confidentiality and security of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information that edX (a 2U, Inc. company) collects through the edX Site when you interact with edX, with Members, with other users, and generally with the edX Site. </p>

           <p> Your information is received and controlled by edX according to this Privacy Policy when you sign up for an edX account or otherwise use the edX Site. </p>

           <p> edX is solely and independently responsible for its own privacy practices. No Member is responsible for edX’s privacy practices.
               If you enroll in a course offered by a Member through the edX Site, information about you and your activity in the course is received and controlled also by that Member as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

           <p> Each Member is solely and independently responsible for its own privacy practices. No Member is responsible for another Member’s privacy practices. Also, edX is not responsible for any Member’s privacy practices.
               If you do not accept the terms of this Privacy Policy, then please do not access, browse, or register for the edX Site or enroll in any courses. If you choose not to provide certain information required to provide you with various products and services offered on the edX Site, then you may not be able to establish a user account or obtain those products or services.</p>

           <p> Any version of this Privacy Policy in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language version will control if there is any conflict.</p>

           <p> INFORMATION THAT EDX COLLECTS FROM YOU (INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION)
               edX directly collects information when you:</p>

            <p> sign up for an edX user account and create an edX user profile; </br>
                enroll and participate in online courses; </br>
               purchase a product or service (for example, Verified Certificates); </br>
               send email messages to edX (including messages to learner support); </br>
               participate in user surveys; and </br>
               participate in public forums, webinars, and other interactive experiences on the edX Site.</br>
               edX also indirectly collects usage information about your visit to the edX Site, as explained in the section below titled Cookies and Tracking Technologies.</p>

           <p> edX does not itself collect or store financial account numbers or identification issued by a governmental entity, employer, or other authority. Instead, if you choose to make a purchase on the edX Site, for example a Verified Certificate, you will be directed to edX’s third-party payment processor and edX’s third-party ID verification service provider. If you do not wish to submit the required authentication or payment information, then you will not be able to obtain a certificate via the edX Site.</p>
